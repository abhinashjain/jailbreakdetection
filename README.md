# jailbreakdetection

Documentation on the various methods which can be used to detect jailbroken devices in much improved and better way. 
Containing the diff of the changes which jailbreak does on the iOS system and comparing jailed with the jailbreak systems.

Along with the source code which can be used directly in the app to detect the state (Jailbroken or Jailed) of the system.

Future work require:
1. To convert this code base into the library and provide an API, so that the developers can directly integrate into their apps.
2. Extend the work for newer/recent devices and iOS version.
3. Add any more good checks or remove any redundant checks.
4. Reduce false positives.
5. Test on more and more devices. 

6. Have to test and update (esp. for phoenix, yalu, liberiOS, elektra, apptap related changes) on version 10 onwards.
